Here is some information about how this site is built, and also the technology's behind it.

This site is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with a blog type layout for the posts.
JQuery is used for loading more post previews. The rest of the pages are mostly hand done html and css, with different css rules for smaller screen sizes.

**The site is also on [Github](https://github.com/Monkeycapers/Jesty-Portfolio)!**
